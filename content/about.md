My name is Marcelo Dellacroce Mansur, I'm from Belo Horizonte and this is just a brief description page.

I created this page in order to centralize my professional social profiles and share some projects that I consider most relevant.

Currently, these projects are the result of my studies in IaC, mainly using:

- Terraform
- Packer
- Ansible
- Github CI
- Amazon AWS

Sometimes, I also venture into the development area, using React + Nodejs, or Golang, where I'm quite new.
